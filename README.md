# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

This project is to learn the React-Datatable. The data is fetched from the fake API Features :

1.Control over the number of items in a single page
2.Search Data
3.Pagination
5. fetch Data



To run the task

1. Fork the project
2. run 'npm install' command at the root folder this will install all the required dependencies
3. run 'npm run dev' to run the code.
